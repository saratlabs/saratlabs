# üìä Econometric Modeling & Machine Learning Series

Welcome to the **Econometrics & ML Series** by Sai Sarat Chandra ‚Äì a dedicated portfolio of minimal yet impactful models integrating economic theory, statistical reasoning, and machine learning applications.

These models are focused on **causal inference, inequality diagnostics, and macro-level inflation shocks** ‚Äî key areas of interest in policy, research, and applied data science.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These are **not part of the Super 9 projects**, but form an **independent, academic-grade econometric stream**.

## üîç Objective

- Apply **econometric modeling** to real-world policy questions  
- Blend **causal inference + interpretability**  
- Use economic indicators to build **statistically explainable models**  
- Demonstrate analytical thinking for policy, consulting, and applied ML roles
