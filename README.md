# 👋 Hi, I'm Sai Sarat Chandra

🎯 **AI & Data Science Explorer**  

Welcome to my curated portfolio of Data Science and Machine Learning projects, developed as part of my journey in building real-world, interdisciplinary AI systems. These projects span diverse domains such as **Economics, FinTech, Pharmaceuticals, Solar Research, Financial Crime Detection**, and **Taxation Systems**.

Each project in this portfolio follows a **structured, research-backed pipeline** that includes:
- Problem Identification and Theoretical Foundation
- Data Sourcing (Open Government Datasets / APIs / Simulated)
- Feature Engineering & Exploratory Data Analysis
- ML Model Building & Evaluation (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LSTM)
- Deployment-ready folder structure (Colab + GitHub integrated)
- Project Summary Report / PDF Export / README Docs
